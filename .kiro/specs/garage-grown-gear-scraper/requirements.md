# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project creates a robust web scraping bot that monitors the Garage Grown Gear sale page (https://www.garagegrowngear.com/collections/sale-1) and automatically saves product data to a Google Sheet. The bot will be hosted on GitHub Actions to run on a scheduled basis, providing continuous monitoring of sale items with their prices, discounts, and availability status.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a deal hunter, I want to automatically scrape product data from the Garage Grown Gear sale page, so that I can track pricing and availability changes without manual monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper runs THEN it SHALL fetch the sale page using Scrapling's Fetcher class
2. WHEN parsing the page THEN it SHALL extract product name, brand, current price, original price, discount percentage, availability status, rating, and product URL for each item
3. WHEN encountering pagination THEN it SHALL automatically navigate through all pages to collect complete data
4. IF a product is sold out THEN it SHALL capture and record the "Sold out" status
5. WHEN extraction is complete THEN it SHALL return a structured list of all product data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the scraped data to be automatically saved to a Google Sheet, so that I can easily analyze trends and share information with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product data is collected THEN it SHALL authenticate with Google Sheets API using service account credentials
2. WHEN writing to the sheet THEN it SHALL include columns for: timestamp, product name, brand, current price, original price, discount percentage, availability, rating, reviews count, and product URL
3. WHEN updating the sheet THEN it SHALL append new data while preserving historical records
4. IF the sheet doesn't exist THEN it SHALL create a new sheet with proper headers
5. WHEN data is written THEN it SHALL format prices as currency and percentages appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the scraper to run automatically on GitHub Actions, so that data collection happens consistently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up automation THEN it SHALL create a GitHub Actions workflow file
2. WHEN scheduling runs THEN it SHALL execute the scraper at configurable intervals (default: every 6 hours)
3. WHEN running in GitHub Actions THEN it SHALL handle all dependencies including Scrapling installation
4. IF scraping fails THEN it SHALL log detailed error information and continue on next scheduled run
5. WHEN credentials are needed THEN it SHALL securely access Google Sheets API keys from GitHub Secrets

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the scraper to be resilient and handle errors gracefully, so that temporary issues don't break the entire monitoring system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN it SHALL retry requests up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN rate limiting is encountered THEN it SHALL respect rate limits and wait appropriately
3. WHEN parsing fails for individual products THEN it SHALL log the error and continue with remaining products
4. IF Google Sheets API is unavailable THEN it SHALL cache data locally and retry on next run
5. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN it SHALL log comprehensive error details for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user monitoring deals, I want to receive notifications about significant changes, so that I can act quickly on good deals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new products are added to sale THEN it SHALL identify and flag them in the data
2. WHEN prices drop significantly (>20%) THEN it SHALL mark these as priority deals
3. WHEN products go from available to sold out THEN it SHALL record the status change timestamp
4. IF configured THEN it SHALL send notifications via webhook or email for significant changes
5. WHEN generating reports THEN it SHALL include summary statistics of deals found

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper runs THEN it SHALL log start time, end time, and total products processed
2. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL log error type, message, and stack trace
3. WHEN performance is measured THEN it SHALL track scraping speed and API response times
4. IF memory usage is high THEN it SHALL implement efficient data processing to minimize resource usage
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN it SHALL provide detailed logs of each major operation
